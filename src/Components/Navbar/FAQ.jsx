                    <h5>What is Auctiondepot all about ? What is the concept?</h5>
                    <p>Auctiondepot.com is an unique online auction platform that
                        allows you to BID on branded products and gives you a change to WIN
                        products at few rupees. It’s a kind of fun bargain deals and online
                        shopping.</p>

                    <h5>Who can participate in auctiondepot's online auctions?</h5>
                    <p>Any one above 18+ years of age can sign up and participate in
                        auctiondepot auctions. Users from outside india / abroad can also
                        join Auctiondepot.com but they will have to pay additional shipping
                        charges for International Shipping.</p>

                    <h5>How does Auctiondepot auctions work?</h5>
                    <p>Registered Auctiondepot users compete each other to win
                        items. The price of the item starts at Rs.0/- and the auction clock
                        starts counting down. Each time a bid is placed, the price of the
                        item increases by a set amount and the auction clock's time gets
                        reset. Once you place a bid, you’re in the lead until the auction
                        clock runs out or someone else places a bid. When the auction clock
                        reaches 00:00 and no more bids are received, the auction is over
                        and the last person who bids wins the auction. winning price and
                        winner's user ID is shown over that closed auction.</p>
